# Snaek
Being the beginning of my coding career, I am very proud of this game.
But be warned - It is.. special.

"Snaek" has been a project at one of my courses at the OTH Regensburg. 
We had to implement a working snake-clone to be allowed to write the exam.
It was the biggest project I worked on so far and I am looking forward to the day in a few years when I take a closer look at the code and see how I have improved. Hopefully.

I might do some enhancements or bug fixes now and then, but all in all it is the final product.
