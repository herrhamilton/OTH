# Snaek

*Being the beginning of my coding career, I am very proud of this game.
But be warned - It is.. special.*

## About
"Snaek" has been a project at one of my courses at the OTH Regensburg. 
We had to implement a working snake-clone to be allowed to write the exam.
It was the biggest project I worked on so far and I am looking forward to the day I take a closer look at the code and see how my coding has improved. Hopefully.

I might do some enhancements or bug fixes now and then, but all in all it is the final product.

## Features
* Play the classic snake game in a new outfit
* Save your personal high score
* An awesome menu which shows all important information (if the mouse works.. More on that later)
* Multiplayer: Who has the longest snake?
* Mouse and (very bad) touch support [currently tested only on Chrome, not working on Firefox]

## Known Bugs
* Mouse works on Chrome, but not tested/not working as intended on the other browsers
* Multiplayer score not working properly
